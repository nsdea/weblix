## APIs
[What is an API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API)
TL;DR: It's an easy way for others to access data (mostly via web)! For example, if you're programming a virutal assistant, a weather API can be implemented into your program, so you don't have to build your own weather forecast station. 

## Wrappers
