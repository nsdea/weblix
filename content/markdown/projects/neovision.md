# NeoVision
*NeoVision* is a feature-rich **[Discord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord_(software)) bot** with **over 50 commands**!
Features include:
- Moderation
- Utilities
- Random just-for-fun tools
- Economy (coin) system for users to earn and spend virtual money
- and much more!

## Why NeoVision?
- The bot is online 24/7 (almost) and
- has **more features than you'll ever need**!
- Also, the bot almost exclusively uses **embeds** for a **clean user interace** and
- actually **shows errors** and their message instead of just doing nothing.
- Furthermore, everything is **open source**, which means everyone can work on it and improve it!

## How does it work?
NeoVision is a Discord bot, which means it can reply to messages written in specific channels. By the way, Discord is a chatting platform, if you didn't know that.

## Fair enough, but how do I add NeoVision so I can use it?
1. Make sure you own a Discord server (you need the "manage server" permission) and you are logged into Discord.
2. Go to the [invite page](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=795743605221621782&permissions=3072&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnsde%2Fneovision%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fdocs%2Fthanks.md&scope=bot).

3. Select a Discord community ("server").
4. Click "next".
5. Click "authorize."
6. There you go! You can, optioally, 

## Credits
A *huge* thank you and shoutout to [JH220](https://jh220.de) for hosting my bot! Without him and his work, the bot wouldn't even run.

## Disclaimer
I got criticism because of the fact that this bot has way too many commands (50+) and there is no reason to have that many.

So, if you're triggered by something like this - just don't touch this bot.

## Commands  (yup, there are a lot!)
